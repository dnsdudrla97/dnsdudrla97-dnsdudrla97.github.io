## Programs
- Developers can write and deploy programs on the Solana blockchain.
- Program (referred to as Smart Contract in Ethereum Protocol)
- The basic role of on-chain Horadong that supports everything such as Defi, NFT, Social Media, etc.
- The program handles the commands of the end user and other programs
- All programs are stateless, all data they interact with is stored in a separate account passed through commands
- The program itself is stored in an account marked as executable
- All programs are owned by BPF Loader and executed in Solana Runtime
- Developers most commonly write Rust and C++ programs, but you can choose any language that targets BPF or LLVM in the backend.
- Every program has a single entry point where instruction processing takes place. (i.e. Process_instruction)
- program_id: pubkey
- accounts: array,
- instruction_data: byte array

## Unlike other blockchains, Solana completely separates code and data.
- All data with which the program interacts is stored in a separate account and -passed by reference through instructions.
- This model allows a single generic program to operate on multiple accounts without further deployment.
- Common examples of this pattern can be found in native and SPL programs.

## Native Program, Solana Program Lib

- It has several programs that serve as key building blocks for on-chain interactions.
- The Natebee program provides the basic functions necessary to operate the validator.
- The most well-known of these programs is the system program.
- Responsible for managing new accounts and transferring SOLs between the two parties.
- The SPL program supports a variety of on-chain activities including token creation, exchange and lending, creating stake pools and maintaining on-chain name services.
- Can be called directly through the SPL token program, while others like the Associated Token Account Program are usually configured as user-defined programs.

## Write Program

- Programs are most commonly developed in Rust and C++, but can be developed in any language targeting LLVM and BPF backends.
- It provides EVM activation compatibility such as Solidity and enables developers to write programs in Solidity.

- Recently, Anchor (similar to Ruby on Rails) is a unique framework that reduces usage and simplifies the (deserialization) process for Rust-based development.
- Programs are generally developed and tested on Localhost and Devnet environments before being distributed to Testnet or Mainnet.

## Program Deploy
- Programs can be deployed through CLI.

``` tsx
    solana program deploy <PROGRAM_FILEPATH>
```

- When the program is distributed, it is compiled into an ELF Sharing Object.
- BPF Byte Code, upload to Solana Cluster
- An Executable program exists in the account (very similar to everything else in Solana), except that this account is marked and assigned as a BPF Loader.
- `program_id` is the address of your account, which will be used to refer to the program in all future transactions
- Supports Upgradable BPF Loader, manages program account (program_id)
- When called, the program is executed by Solana Runtime.
